// Stop -> top + LSP
  This code produces a weight per event, calling the method
 
 double Reweight_Stop_to_TopChi0_with_SUSYmodel (std::vector<SUSYGenParticle> genParticles, double thetaMixingReference, double thetaMixingTarget)

 which goes from a SUSY MC generated with thetaMixingReference to another SUSY MC scenario with thetaMixingTarget. It requires a vector of `struct SUSYGenParticle` which basically contains the info on Status = 3 particles at the generation level. 

 This (together with other utilities) is in Stop_TopChi0_Reweighting.C and the script to run it in Stop_TopChi0_Reweighting.

 A test program is provided in TopReweight.C and TopReweight.

// Stop -> b chargino -> b W LSP
  This code produces a weight per event, calling the method
 
 double Reweight_T2bW (double thetaChi_eff, double thetaW_eff, std::vector<SUSYGenParticle> genParticles)

 which goes from a fully flat phase space generation for the subsequent two-body decays: chargino -> W LSP, and W -> f fbar', to a scenario defined by the L/R mixing angles thetaChi_eff and thetaW_eff. The first angle defines the mixing in the stop -> b chargino decay. The thetaW_eff angle defines the mixing in the chargino -> W LSP decay. The convention is the standard one, employed in I. Low, arXiv: 1304.0491. It requires a vector of `struct SUSYGenParticle` which basically contains the info on Status = 3 particles at the generation level. 

 This method is in T2bW_reweighting.C. A script to build a library with it is T2bW_reweighting.

 A test program is provided in T2bW_referenceTest.C and T2bW_referenceTest.
